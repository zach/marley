A .ma (MayaAscii) parser in Ragel and tools.

1. Status

Right now, there is just a utility I wrote called matree, but this will serve
as a basis for a library and some simple tools that use that library.

2. Installing

You'll need Ragel:

http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/

Then just use Ragel to compile matree.rl into matree.c and compile that. 

I've only tested this on Mac OS X 10.5 and Fedora Core 6.

3. License

The files in this project are licensed under the MIT license as explained in
the LICENSE file.

4. Future

In addition to a tool to print nodes with their full path, it's anticipated
that there will be a tool to categorize the nodes in a .ma file by type.
I'm interested in the real-world needs that tools using this library can fill,
things that can't be easily done using text tools like grep and sed.
